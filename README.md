# Email for the Visually Imparied
_________________________________
## Description:
This application is voice controlled email which can be used just as regular email is used, such as sending work information or telling your friends about a dinner party.
It was created with the thought of helping people who are visaully impaired. It uses voice to text and text to speech technologies to allow users to send wmails without the need of a keyboard and mouse.

_________________________________
## Purpose:
My goal is to improve and create a more accessible email to allow disabled people to enjoy the benefits of the technology. This project is aimed at people who have struggled historically with using technology. Given the timeline of the project the application will be limited to basic features including: a basic UI that allows any user to send emails without the need of voice controls, a simple database to store contact information, ability to send emails with voice controls
